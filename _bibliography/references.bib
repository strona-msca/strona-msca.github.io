abstract = {Common coding theory posits there are cycles between perceptions and actions at the fundamental logic of the nervous system. An action performed by an agent modifies its external environment and/or internal states. The agent is able to complete a given goal by performing a sequence of actions. In this work, shared representations for both perception and action and their processing algorithm are presented that suggest goal-oriented alternative actions even with incomplete information. The alternative actions provide more opportunities for a service robot to achieve goals. Knowledge plays significant roles to successfully complete service tasks. Most knowledge inference mechanisms assume complete and correct knowledge about the environment. Real world environments are often uncertain and only partially observable. Thus, intelligent service robots may have an incomplete knowledge base which includes false negatives and false positives as well as true positives. False negatives and false positives can prevent service robots from completing their service tasks. A case study reveals that the proposed method has proved valuable to suggest alternatives for false information as well as to build reactive plans with customary efficiency.},

abstract = {Current computational approaches to learning visual object categories require thousands of training images, are slow, cannot learn in an incremental manner and cannot incorporate prior information into the learning process. In addition, no algorithm presented in the literature has been tested on more than a handful of object categories. We present an method for learning object categories from just a few training images. It is quick and it uses prior information in a principled way. We test it on a dataset composed of images of objects belonging to 101 widely varied categories. Our proposed method is based on making use of prior information, assembled from (unrelated) object categories which were previously learnt. A generative probabilistic model is used, which represents the shape and appearance of a constellation of features belonging to the object. The parameters of the model are learnt incrementally in a Bayesian manner. Our incremental algorithm is compared experimentally to an earlier batch Bayesian algorithm, as well as to one based on maximum likelihood. The incremental and batch versions have comparable classification performance on small training sets, but incremental learning is significantly faster, making real-time learning feasible. Both Bayesian methods outperform maximum likelihood on small training sets. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
